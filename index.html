                    Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.
                    Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the first film in the
                    Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of
                    Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as
                    Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In
                    the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and
                    master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man.

                    A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New
                    Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel
                    put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing.
                    Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast
                    Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June
                    2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that
                    are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their
                    own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions
                    of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to
                    create the title character.

                    Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story
                    takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the
                    first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking
                    and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.

                    The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, exceeding the number
                    that worked on the studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt launched a new
                    division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to
                    aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a
                    starring role. The original score was led by Marcin Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of
                    several licensed artists.

                    After years of anticipation, CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows,
                    and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.
                    It received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics, although some of its
                    gameplay elements received mixed responses, while its themes and representation of transgender
                    characters received some criticism. It was also widely criticized for bugs, particularly in the
                    console versions, which suffered from performance problems; Sony removed it from the PlayStation
                    Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems. CD Projekt
                    became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at
                    downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared
                    with a settlement of US$1.85 million.
